# OceanPulse
This project aims to develop a mobile application that empowers citizens to report ocean and beach pollution, while integrating satellite data, buoy sensor data, and AI models for validation and prediction. The system enhances marine pollution monitoring by combining ground-level observations with remote sensing and predictive analytics.

Key Features

📸 Pollution Reporting: Upload photos, auto-capture GPS location, and categorize pollution type.

🛰 Satellite Verification: Cross-check user reports with recent satellite imagery (Sentinel-2, MODIS).

🤖 AI-Powered Validation: Detect anomalies and verify reports using multi-source data.

🔍 Explainable AI (SHAP): Provides insights into why the model flagged a pollution event.

🌐 Real-Time Map: Visualize citizen reports, AI predictions, and pollution hotspots.

📡 Offline Support & Sync: Submit reports offline, sync later when connected.
