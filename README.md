# OceanPulse
This project aims to develop a mobile application that empowers citizens to report ocean and beach pollution, while integrating satellite data, buoy sensor data, and AI models for validation and prediction. The system enhances marine pollution monitoring by combining ground-level observations with remote sensing and predictive analytics.
